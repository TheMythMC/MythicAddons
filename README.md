# Mythic Addons

# Why?
These are just things taken from other carpet extensions that I have ported over to 1.17.1 myself. These are used on my private SMP.

# Building
First, download the repository by doing
```
git clone https://github.com/Mythbusters123/MythicAddons.git
```
And then build the project by doing
```
./gradlew idea
```
