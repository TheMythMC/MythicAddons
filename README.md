## Mythic Addons

# Why?
These are just things taken from other carpet extensions that I have ported over to 1.17.1 myself. These are used on my private SMP.

# Downloading
Go to https://github.com/TheMythMC/MythicAddons/actions/, and then click on the latest one. At the bottom (if you are on the "Summary" tab) should be some text that said "Compiled artifacts for XXXXXXXXXXXX". Download the ZIP and take the .jar file that doesn't have any prefix (no -dev, or -sources)

# Building

## Releases
Look at the releases tab, and download the jar without a prefix (no -dev or -sources)

## Latest commit
First, download the repository by doing
```
git clone https://github.com/TheMythMC/MythicAddons.git
```
And then build the project by doing
```
./gradlew idea
```
