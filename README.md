## Mythic Addons

# Why?
These are just things taken from other carpet extensions that I have ported over to 1.17.1 myself. These are used on my private SMP.

This mod is made so that certain things in vanilla (such as transporting a large amount of shulker boxes or crafting a crap ton of dispensers) are made a trillion times easier, with just a couple lines of code. Of course, this takes away part of the grind, but does anyone LIKE crafting dispensers? Didn't think so.
